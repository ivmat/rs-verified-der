"""export_closure.py — export or verify the COMPLETE, self-contained closure of the acceptance
family's consumer tools: `format_acceptance/tools/check_acceptance.py`,
`protocol_acceptance/tools/acceptance_protocol.py`, and `format_acceptance/tools/spec_inventory.py`
— every `.py` module they load and every `.toml`/`.md` policy file they read at runtime — plus a
mechanically-recomputable manifest (`CLOSURE.json`), so a downstream repo can vendor ONE directory
instead of hand-picking files (the old vendor pattern this replaces pinned three files by name and
silently drifted when a fourth file became load-bearing).

`export` requires a nonexistent `--dest` (including no dangling symlink). It copies into a fresh,
unique sibling staging directory, scans there, and renames it into place only after success.
Failure cleans up only that staging directory; existing destinations are refused untouched.
`--dest` MUST resolve outside this repository: exporting into the source checkout makes an
untracked export show up in `git status`, so `source_dirty` would read `true` even from a clean
tagged commit. `export` refuses (exit 1, creating nothing) a `--dest` inside the checkout.

**No file is rewritten at export.** Every candidate file is copied BYTE-FOR-BYTE (`shutil.copy2`);
`export` then scans the copied bytes for apparatus/privacy tokens and REFUSES (nonzero, listing
every hit) if anything remains — fail-closed, never a silent rewrite. An earlier revision of this
tool tried to auto-redact matched tokens in the copied text; that TEXT TRANSFORM corrupted its own
exported copy (a regex literal defining the home-path pattern textually contains the very substring
it matches, so rewriting it produced a syntactically broken file — an unterminated string literal).
The fix is the one stated above: neutralize offending prose IN THE SOURCE FILES THEMSELVES (a
one-time reviewed edit to comments/docstrings and seven output-string exceptions recorded in the
adoption guide's review notes, never the CLASS-LOCK frozen spec text),
then let export be a pure copy-and-verify step with no text transformation in its own right.

The closure is derived MECHANICALLY, never hand-listed: a small in-process harness runs each real
CLI (via `runpy`, exactly as `python3 <script> ...` would — same `sys.path[0]` rule) against the
repo's own worked example (`protocol_acceptance/examples/rust-delivery/`), with a
`sys.addaudithook` recording every file the interpreter actually `open()`s, filtered to paths
inside this repository with a `.py`, `.toml`, or `.md` suffix. `.md` is in that set for a verified
reason, not by generosity: `check_core.py`'s B14 kind-admission check (`_binding_admitted_kinds`)
reads a binding's `admits = [...]` declaration from a MACHINE-READABLE fenced TOML block inside a
Markdown DOCUMENT under `format_acceptance/profiles/bindings/` (`code.md`, `code/rust.md`) — this
is genuine runtime policy data, not frozen prose, and a first cut of this tool that filtered to
`.py`/`.toml` only produced a closure that failed `[subject].kind = "rust-crate"` admission the
moment it was smoke-tested standalone (caught by this tool's own `--selftest`, not by inspection).
The frozen Class prose under `format_acceptance/spec/` (`CLASS-LOCK.toml`'s own file set) is
excluded on purpose (`EXCLUDE_PREFIXES`): confirmed, none of it is `open()`-ed by an ordinary
validation run. Ten probe commands are run (§ PROBES below) so the trace covers every code path a
real Rust/Kani producer's session exercises: `check_acceptance.py`, `check_core.py` (directly — kept
as a cross-check even though the 0.3.1 dispatch fix means `check_acceptance.py` alone now already
reaches the binding chain), `acceptance_protocol.py`'s own `check-contract` / `check-package` /
`coverage` / `check-decision` / `check-states` / `impact` verbs, `spec_inventory.py`, and one
synthetic minimal contract that sets `[acceptance].assurance_class` (the worked example does not,
so `assurance-classes.toml` would otherwise never be opened).

Apparatus hygiene: `hygiene_violations()` scans copied bytes for home-relative paths, known
reviewer/model-name tokens, and a small embedded set of internal-only apparatus tokens (the same category
`gates/check_core_generic.py` polices for the Class spec text — the token LIST is duplicated here,
deliberately NOT imported at module load, so `verify` never depends on this repository's layout;
see "Standalone by construction" below). Every pattern literal in this module is assembled from two
or more non-matching string fragments at import time specifically so this scanner's OWN pattern
definitions never self-match when this very file is one of the files being scanned (verified by
this module's own `--selftest`).

**Standalone by construction.** No module-level code in this file touches this repository's layout
(no `REPO_ROOT`-anchored file read at import time). `verify`/`_verify` read only files under the
`--dest` directory the caller names. `REPO_ROOT` (used only by `export`/`discover_closure`, i.e.
the export side, which only ever runs from this repository) is computed as a bare path expression,
never dereferenced until an export-side function actually needs it. This is verified end to end by
`--selftest`: it relocates a completed export to a SECOND directory and runs
`python3 <relocated>/export_closure.py verify --dest <relocated>` as a real subprocess — the exact
command a downstream consumer's CI runs — with no access to this repository at all.
